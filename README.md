# Multimodal Phishing Detection using Gen-AI

This project identifies phishing websites using **multimodal data** — both **HTML text** and **image text (OCR)**.  
Modern phishing websites use advanced techniques like deceptive UI, screenshots, and hidden text inside images.  
So this project combines multiple signals to detect phishing pages more accurately.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Nowadays, many online scams happen through fake websites that look almost real.  
They steal passwords, OTPs, and bank information.

To solve this, I built a **multimodal phishing detection system** using:

- **HTML content**  
- **Images extracted from the webpage**
- **OCR text from images (EasyOCR)**
- **Deep text embeddings using RoBERTa**
- **A classifier trained on combined features**

This helps detect even **very realistic phishing pages**.

## 🧠 Key Features

### ✅ 1. HTML Downloader (Part 1)
- Automatically downloads raw HTML from each URL.
- Saves content into text files.
- Used for text-based feature extraction.

**File:** `part1_html_downloader.py`

---

### ✅ 2. Image Scraper (Part 2)
- Uses Playwright to open webpages.
- Extracts all images larger than **200×200px**.
- OCR reads the text inside images (important for phishing).

**File:** `part2_image_scraper.py`

---

### ✅ 3. OCR + Embedding + Training (Part 3)
- Reads HTML + OCR text.
- Converts text into embeddings using RoBERTa.
- Trains a classifier to distinguish **phishing vs legitimate** URLs.
- Saves embeddings + model.

## 📊 Dataset

I collected **34,000+ URLs** from:

- Mendeley Phishing Dataset  
- Various trusted legitimate sites  

Each URL contains:

- HTML content  
- Images (converted to text using OCR)  
- Labels: *phishing* / *legitimate*
